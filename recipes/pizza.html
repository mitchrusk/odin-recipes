    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare the Dough:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In a bowl, dissolve sugar in warm water and add yeast. Allow it to sit
          for 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Make a well in the
          center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mix until a dough forms, then knead on a floured surface until smooth.
          Place in a greased bowl, cover, and let it rise for about 1 hour or
          until doubled in size.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Make the Pizza Sauce:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In a saucepan, combine crushed tomatoes, minced garlic, oregano,
          basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer over low heat for 15-20 minutes,
          stirring occasionally.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Roll and Shape the Dough:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C).</li>
        <li>
          Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired
          thickness.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a pizza stone or a baking sheet.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Assemble the Pizza:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Spread the homemade tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a
          small border.
        </li>
        <li>Arrange slices of fresh mozzarella on top.</li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes or until the crust is
          golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Finish with Freshness:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Remove from the oven and scatter fresh basil leaves on the hot pizza.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil for that authentic finishing
          touch.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Serve and Enjoy:</li>
      <ul>
        Slice your Classic Margherita Pizza and savor the delightful combination
        of the crisp crust, flavorful tomato sauce, and gooey melted mozzarella.
        Buon appetito!
